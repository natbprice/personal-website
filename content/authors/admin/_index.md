I enjoy solving challenging problems using data visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, optimization, and simulation. I have an interdisciplinary background and have worked worked in aerospace, biomedical, marketing, and natural resource fields. In my current role, I am building a web-based application for customer-base analysis and developing statistical models of customer recruitment, retention, and attrition.
